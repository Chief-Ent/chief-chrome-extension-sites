# chief-chrome-extension-sites

## Usage
In `sites.json`, add the reference, name, and image name of the link that you want to add. The items listed in `sites.json` are ordered the same way as in the chrome extension. Ensure that any new items are in correct JSON format. 

Next, add the image reference to `./assets/`. The ideal image size is 30 pixels by 30 pixels.

### After updating, it may take a while for the extension to update due to client side and server side caching
To serve the most recent content, the chrome extension uses [gitcdn.link](https://gitcdn.link), which has a 2 hour cache.

## About
This serves as a list of sites for the Chief Chrome Extension (private repo).
